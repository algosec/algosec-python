Framework tools and api clients to work with your on on-premises Algosec services.
Currently only certain range of API functions are implemented to communicate with:

* Algosec BusinessFlow

* Algosec FirewallAnalyzer

Contribution
------------

Currently the sdk is pretty basic, and every contribution will be welcome with a proper PR :)

Developing
----------

To setup the project for local development, make sure you have a Python 2.7 virtualenv setup::

    mkvirtualenv --python=python2.7 algobotframeworkenv -a .

and then to install the package run::

    pip install -e .

This will install all the dependencies and set the project up for local usage and development .
