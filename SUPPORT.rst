This template/solution is released under an as-is, best effort, support policy. These scripts should be seen as
community supported and Algosec Systems Ltd. will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide
technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support
options such as Algosec support teams and backline support options. The underlying product used by the scripts or
templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying
or using the template or script itself.

Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub repository or sites other than our official
Downloads page are provided under the best effort policy.
